Bots sorting chips

This problem bears some similarities to day 7 from aoc2015.

Once again I look at the input data to see what is possible; each bot
can distribute its two chips as follows:
bot -> bot & bot
bot -> output & bot
bot -> output & output

Also, there are some like
chip -> bot

The first half of the program parses out the input. The top 3 statements
have bots distributing chips with a source bot and 2 destinations, either
bots or output bins.

The last ones, which give chips to various bots, are pushed onto a stack.

In the second half, I pop the chip -> bot statements off the stack, and
execute as many distribution statements as possible. By the time I finish
the distribution after the last chip -> bot statement, the answers are found.
