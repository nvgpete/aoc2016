Moving data around on an array of disks arranged as a grid.

There is no code that gives an answer for this one.

For part a, I did several several sorts on various columns of the data like:
sort -n -k 2 d22a.txt | more

This showed me there were 1050 nodes in all, 1 empty, 6 too large to move
and the rest small enough to move to the empty node. None of them could be
moved to any but the empty node. Thus the answer to part a was 
1050 - 6(immovable) - 1(empty) = 1043.

Part b was analagous to one of those puzzles with 15 slidable squares and a
hole where you tried to move all the slidable squares to form the numbers
1-15 in order or sometimes a picture, except lots bigger with a few
immovable square. There is a d22b.c program, but it merely prints out the
layout. From that, one can just count that it takes 45 moves to get the
space next to the * and move the * left 1. For each additional move left of
the * it takes 5 moves, times 28 nodes to move to get to the top left corner
for a total of 185 moves in all.
