Moving through small rooms with doors locked or unlocked based on MD5 hashes.

By now you have probably read my feelings on MD5 hashing in c; if not see
notes from days 5 and 14.

The starting string, 'mmsxrhfx', is embedded in the program. Don't forget to
use -lcrypto in the compilation.

Usually if I have both php and c versions, they use essentially the same
methods. However, In this case, I used a FIFO queue and mixed array in php
since they are easy to implement there. In c, I used recursive function
calls. The c version also has the usual shifts and &'s to isolate the hex
bytes. Other than that, the code is pretty similar, and about the same size.
Since the program runs pretty fast, the c version was about 10 times faster.
