Finding safe and unsafe tiles in a room (very long and narrow for part b).

We don't need to keep the whole room, just two rows, which we can swap back
and forth as we move down the length. Also, an extra safe tile on either
end makes boundary conditions simpler.

Also note that the rather complex rules are equivalent to: 
If the diagnonal left and right tiles are different, it's a trap; otherwise
it's safe.

I wondered whether I'd need to look for further simplification to do 400000
rows, but since it ran in about 1/4 second that wasn't necessary.
