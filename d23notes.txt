Opening a safe by running self-modifying code
(Hopefully, the cpu does not have a long instruction pipeline)

Fortunately, the parsing half of the program already works on the new 'tgl'
instruction. (Good thing there weren't any other opcodes starting with 't').

The execution part requires more than just adding the new instruction, since
now some of the old instructions may end up with illegal operands after being
tgl'ed. Also, there are some new opcode operand combinations.

The problem warns that the second part may take a bit, and it did, 21.5
seconds.
