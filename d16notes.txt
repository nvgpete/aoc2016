Good example of how c pointers can make short work of a problem that looks
more complex than it is. Note that '0'^1='1' (and vice versa) and 
(logical)+'0'={'0','1'} allowing me to work with  characters '0' and '1'
though the code would probably have been a bit quicker if I converted to
binary 0 & 1 and back.
