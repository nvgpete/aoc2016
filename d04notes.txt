Find the room with Santa's stuff

Pretty simple. The program dumps out all the legal room names since part b of
the problem asked for the room where "North Pole objects are stored" and the
room is named "Northpole objects storage". I didn't feel like writing a
linguistics analyzer to get the second from the first so after I tried
programatically looking for "North Pole objects" and failed, I just manually 
scanned through the list of valid rooms.

Something like
 ./d04a | sort -k 2 
gives a more organized list of rooms.
