Super duper compression algorithm

The first part is straightforward.
Since the second part requires decompressing pieces that result from
previous decompressions, recursion seems to be the answer. The only
interesting part (to me at least) is the insertion and removal of \0 string
terminators so that the original string never needs to be copied as we
recurse down the levels of (mXn).
