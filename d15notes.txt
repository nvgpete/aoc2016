Dropping balls through rotating disks with slots

Easy problem. For part a, I just looped starting at t=0 and looking for a
time that the ball would go through. I could have done the same for part b,
but it was easier to notice that all the disks had prime numbers of
positions, so that after the first success, subsequent successes could be
found by multiplying the numbers of positions of the first 6 disks together
and adding that to the first success time until I found one that worked for
the 7th disk.
