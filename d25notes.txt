Create a clock signal for the antenna from assembly code

I wasn't sure what they meant here - a string of 0's and 1's output, or
maybe a string of 6's (=1010). Sometimes you just have to run the code and
see what you get. 

The 'out' instruction was already parsed properly (no other opcodes starting
with 'o' !) so it was just a matter of adding it to the interpreter. I
started by just printing whatever was output, which at least showed me that
I should expect a sequence of just 0's and 1's.

I changed the 'out' execution so it checked if it was alternating 0's and 1's
for at least 20 iterations and broke out of the execution loop to try the
next value of 'a' if that failed. 

Fortunately there were no values of 'a' that executed indefinitely without
doing any output.
